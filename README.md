   3. What [problems](https://padlet.com/kohwyhow/what-problems-do-you-want-to-solve-gjcypqiq99ko1wke) do you want to solve?

## 09.00 am: Looker Studio
   1. [Create](https://mail.google.com/mail/) a Google account (you can use your personal one too, if you prefer)
   2. Head to [Looker Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/), using another tab
   3. Download as [CSV](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IaonaJj-c5Ud76Uc9WeRiMSlKLTNnbg-BCUxOoZrXn0/edit?usp=sharing) from here and upload to Looker Studio
   4. Build a few charts and filters
       - What are the total `sales` by `category` and `year`?
       - What are the total `profit` by `category` and `year`?
       - Which `cities` have generated the highest `sales`?
       - What are the `margins` by `segment`?
       - Make your dashboard look better using a [color palette generator](https://coolors.co/)
   5. Practice by creating another page named `Customer`, and using any chart/table:
       - What is the name of the Customer with the Highest Sales in New York City?
       - What Sub-Category did this Customer buy, and how much Sales and Profit did this Customer generate for the company?
       - Open question: Is the business doing better or worse off from 2014 to 2017?
    
   - Source: Superstore sample data from [Tableau](https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls)
